/**
 * The <code>TIMESTAMPDIFF</code> function, which calculates the difference between two timestamps.

 * </blockquote>
 *
 * The interval time unit can one of the following literals:

 * <li>MICROSECOND (and synonyms SQL_TSI_MICROSECOND, FRAC_SECOND)</li>
 * <li>SECOND (and synonym SQL_TSI_SECOND)</li>

 * <li>QUARTER (and synonym SQL_TSI_QUARTER)</li>
 * <li>YEAR (and synonym  SQL_TSI_YEAR)</li>
