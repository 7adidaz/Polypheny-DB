/**
 * Management of materialized query results.
 *
 * An actor ({@link ch.unibas.dmi.dbis.polyphenydb.materialize.MaterializationActor}) maintains the state of all materializations in the system and is wrapped in a service
 * ({@link ch.unibas.dmi.dbis.polyphenydb.materialize.MaterializationService}) for access from other parts of the system.
 *
 * Optimizer rules allow Polypheny-DB to rewrite queries using materializations, if they are valid (that is, contain the same result as executing their defining query) and lower cost.
 *
 * In future, the actor may manage the process of updating materializations, instantiating materializations from the intermediate results of queries, and recognize what materializations would be useful based on actual query load.
